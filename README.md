#### Description:

-In the light of technological and material development, a new problem has arisen for us - humans - which is the subject of research by scientists and researchers, which is â€œprocrastination, a decrease in the level of happiness in humans teenagers in particular".

-From this point of view, a lack of human achievements appeared on the individual level in particular.
I'm on this very simple site. I'm just giving an idea, no more. This means that this site if it is but in a deeper and larger way. It can be a global and cool site. 
-And about this siteThe idea is to simply try to put two things and they are

-1- Timer for achievements 2- Motivational methods,I think quotes are very good to motivate people

## How the webpage works?
On this site, we have two bases
The first is CSS and the second is HTML
I did not put the javascript separately because I don't think there is a need for that and I was more comfortable with this method 
And there is a little icon I added  it :)
I use flask just for render page
ABOUT BASE.HTML (
Head includes bootstrap,jquery, title,icon, and fixing the width

body includes two things 1-js 2-HTML

1-1  js for tabs 
1-2  js  for paragraphs 
1-3  js for timer 
1-4  js for quotes NOTE: i got a ready list Sorry for that :)
2-1  html code for tabs 
2-2  html code for paragraphs
2-3  html code for timer
2-4  html code for quotes 

finally, CSS 
I think this one is very clear, nothing special maybe I used grid areas in the timer :)

### Routing
- i use flask to routeing  the website 
## Possible improvements

As all applications this one can also be improved. Possible improvements:

-  more details in timer like make other Options (120,60,50,10,5)
- make account and have database includes (user,password,how many minutes he/she work , how many rest)
- make compare between users
- make a list to do or cheack box 
- make achivement record
